## Movie classification task

* movies_classificator_TF-IDF.ipynb is a **baseline** approach which is used for solving our classification task.
* movies_classificator_CBOW.ipynb is our model which uses CBOW in order to train the word embeddings and (slightly) outperforms the given baseline. Also we have done some preprocessing by removing some meaningless words and signs.

## Find ipynb results attached in the end of the each notebook. 

### Remark. Also we tried to implement CNN Text Classifier, but this solution is not ready yet.
